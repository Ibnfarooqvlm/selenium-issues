  ðŸ’¬ It looks like this is a request for support or a question


  ðŸ’¡ A better way to address this is:


  * ðŸ“« Send questions and support requests to the [Selenium user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users)

  * ðŸ“® Post them to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)

  * ðŸ—£ Join us in the [IRC/Slack channel](https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com/) where the community can help you as well
